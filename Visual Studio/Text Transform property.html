		<h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
		<div style="width: 600px" ;>
			<p>
				<span class="uppercase">
					Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
					standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
					make a type specimen book.
				</span>
				<span id="capitalize">
					It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
					unchanged.
				</span>
				<span class="lowercase">
					It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
					recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
